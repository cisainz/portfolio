               <h3>Bio</h3>
              <p>Born in Hot Spring, Arkansas, I grew up really loving the arts. I sent a lot of time drawing and coloring as a kid. I would draw characters from my favorite animated shows and graphic novels, and eventually started making up my own stories and characters. That interest followed me into high school where I learned more about 
              the adobe suite and got interested in graphic design and digital art. The more I worked the with thr programs the more I recognized that I could apply my interests in art to my future career. I got into web design my sophmore year of college, and began taking classes to learn how to use my artistic skills to create web designs
              that would be an engaging and informative experience for users.</p>
              
              <p>My goals for the near future are to build off of this portfolio by getting more experience, and designing an updated version that really shows off my artistic skills. Unfortunately I haven't had too much spare time to devote to it yet, so that design is still in the development stage, but I hope to have it ready early this next year. 
              I also  want to add a section to the portfolio to show off my illustration skills. That's my other passion in life, and something I've carried from childhood.</p>
