              <img class="bio-pic" src="/portfolio/assets/images/profile_pic-01.jpg" align="left" height="240" />
              
               <h3>Bio</h3>
              <p>Born in Hot Spring, Arkansas, I grew up really loving the arts. I sent a lot of time drawing and coloring as a kid. I would draw characters from my favorite animated shows and graphic novels, and eventually started making up my own stories and characters. That interest followed me into high school where I learned more about 
              the adobe suite and got interested in graphic design and digital art. The more I worked the with thr programs the more I recognized that I could apply my interests in art to my future career. I got into web design my sophmore year of college, and began taking classes to learn how to use my artistic skills to create web designs
              that would be an engaging and informative experience for users.</p>
              
              <p>My goals for the near future are to build off of this portfolio by getting more experience, and designing an updated version that really shows off my artistic skills. Unfortunately I haven't had too much spare time to devote to it yet, so that design is still in the development stage, but I hope to have it ready early this next year. 
              I also  want to add a section to the portfolio to show off my illustration skills. That's my other passion in life, and something I've carried from childhood.</p>
              
              <h3>Elevator Speech</h3>
              <p>Over the years I’ve accumulated many skills sets. I have worked with the majority of the adobe suite a lot in my times in school and in my personal life. I also have a lot of experience working in photography and videography. I’ve freelanced for a few weddings in recent years, and have done a few photoshoots. I think these skills give me 
              what clients need when it comes to design, especially when they are still needing to build a brand and an online presence. I haven’t fully grasped the intricacies of the backend, but I’m always wanting to refine my skills and learn new ones. My studies in graphic design, web design, illustration, photography, and videography have giving me the 
              ability to set clients up with a presence in the digital age. I can design the business cards, letter heads, logo, ads, UI/UX of their site, video ads, photo library, and more.</p>

            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Something that’s really important to me is having a career that I can be creative in, and grow in my creativity with. Art has been a big part 
            of me ever since I was a young 4th grader drawing cars in my math notebook, and I have always known my calling was in the creative field. Even as my 
            interests shifted into music and video production as a teenager, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in creating and expressing myself with art. Now, as 
            I head into my last semester of college, nothing has changed. I still want those same things, but now I am more educated in how to do so and have a diverse skill set to help me through. </p>
            
            <p>I have had a lot of classes and experience with the Adobe suite. I have also worked with camera and audio equipment extensively, which has given 
            me all the tools to build clients’ branding. I can create business cards, letter heads, and print adds using my photography and Adobe Indesign. I can design the 
            logos, icons, and UI layout using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD. I can use my camera and audio equipment to record video ads and content for the site. </p>
            
            <p>I find the diversity of my skills gives me the tools to work in many different avenues of the branding and web design process. I hope that these skills 
            will also give me a chance to bring my clients and employers a collaborator who can bring a lot to the table, and I hope to learn a lot more in my journey. </p>
